RECOMMENDATIONS:
• ADJUST MOMENTUM THRESHOLDS: Try loosening your criteria for when to buy/sell—your signals were likely too strict
  → Consider reducing momentum thresholds from current levels to capture more trading opportunities
  → Implement dynamic thresholds that adapt to market volatility
• REVIEW POSITION SIZING: Ensure you're not risking too much (or too little) on each trade
  → Implement Kelly Criterion or risk-parity based position sizing
  → Consider reducing position sizes during high volatility periods
• IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT: Add stop-losses, volatility filters, or correlation controls
  → Implement trailing stop-losses at 2-3% below entry prices
  → Add volatility filters to avoid trading during extreme market conditions
  → Monitor correlation between positions and limit sector concentration
• USE MULTIPLE TIMEFRAMES: Combining short-, mid-, and long-term momentum might help
  → Combine 20-day, 60-day, and 120-day momentum signals
  → Weight signals based on their historical effectiveness
  → Use shorter timeframes for entry/exit and longer for trend confirmation
• DEFENSIVE POSITIONING: In volatile markets, consider reducing exposure or rotating into less risky sectors
  → Reduce overall portfolio exposure during high volatility periods
  → Rotate into defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) during market stress
  → Increase cash allocation when volatility exceeds historical averages
• TRY ALTERNATIVE FACTORS: Momentum may not be working right now. Try combining it with value, quality, or low volatility factors
  → Combine momentum with value factors (P/E, P/B ratios)
  → Add quality metrics (ROE, debt-to-equity, earnings stability)
  → Include low volatility stocks to reduce portfolio risk
  → Consider mean reversion strategies as a complement to momentum
• RECHECK LOOKBACK PERIODS: The period over which you calculate momentum might be too short/long for this market cycle
  → Test different lookback periods (10, 20, 50, 100 days)
  → Use adaptive lookback periods based on market regime
  → Consider using exponential moving averages instead of simple moving averages
• STRONG PERFORMER DETECTED: NVDA showed exceptional performance (125.8%)
  → Analyze what factors contributed to this outperformance
  → Consider sector rotation strategies based on strong performers
• WEAK PERFORMER IDENTIFIED: DIS underperformed significantly (-12.2%)
  → Review risk management for similar stocks
  → Consider short-selling opportunities or avoiding similar stocks
